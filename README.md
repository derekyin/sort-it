# Sort it 


## Inspiration
Toronto suffers from a 26% contamination rate in their recycling, that is nearly a quarter of all the recycling completed does not actually end up being recycled. Contamination happens when non-recyclable materials or garbage end up in the recycling system, from leftover food in containers to non-recyclable plastics to clothing and propane tanks.

To address this problem, we created sort-it.

## What it does
The app helps everyone do their part in working towards a greener planet. Users open the app and take a photo of the trash that they are unsure about, and the app tells them where it goes! In addition to this feature, user can enter their phone number and the day of the week they wish to be reminded about garbage days.
